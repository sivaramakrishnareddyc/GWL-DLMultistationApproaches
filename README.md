Code for Multi station approaches

Chidepudi, S. K. R., Massei, N., Jardani, A., Dieppois, B., Henriot, A., and Fournier, M.: Training deep learning models with a multi-station approach and static aquifer attributes for groundwater level simulation: whatâ€™s the best way to leverage regionalised information?, EGUsphere [preprint], https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-794, 2024.


For the MODWT library, please install the library following instructions at: https://github.com/gwmodeling/challenge/tree/main/submissions/team_M2C_BRGM/scripts/mwtsa_cima

Download GWL data by running the ADES_data_download/ades_data_download.py script and ERA5 data using ERA5_download.py

For DL models, Change the location of input files and run the individual scripts from subfolders (Standalone and Wavelet) for all the approaches.
